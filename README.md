This project focuses on the application of machine learning to predict whether rainfall will occur on a particular day. 
Traditional methods, often dependent on human expertise and meteorological models, sometimes fail to capture the 
complexities of weather patterns, leading to inaccuracies in predictions. To address this, our approach leverages historical 
weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to train a machine learning model that can predict 
daily rainfall occurrences with higher accuracy. Using supervised learning techniques, we develop and test a model that 
identifies patterns and relationships within the data, ultimately making predictions about whether rainfall will occur. The 
model will be evaluated based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This project demonstrates how 
machine learning can offer a more reliable method for rainfall prediction, potentially enhancing planning in sectors 
reliant on accurate weather forecasts, such as agriculture, water management, and emergency services.
